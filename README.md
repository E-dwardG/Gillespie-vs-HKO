This is a project by me (Edward Gilbert) covering the differences in performance of the Hu-Kang-Othmer and Gillespie algorithms.
There is code available for both algorithms, exploring when we have populations divided into 2 or 3 classes.
Inspiration for this came from an undergraduate research paper I read, which is unpublished (sorry).
I also managed to create a new method called deep HKO, which I explore further.
For further questions, reach out to me!
