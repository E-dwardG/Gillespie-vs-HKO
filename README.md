This is a project by me (Edward Gilbert) covering the differences in performance of the Hu-Kang-Othmer and Gillespie algorithms
Inspiration for this came from an undergraduate research paper I read, which is unpublished (sorry)
I also managed to create a new method called deep HKO, which I explore further
For further questions, reach out to me on LinkedIn!
